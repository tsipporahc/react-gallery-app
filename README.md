# React Gallery App

Treehouse Techdegree Unit 7 Project

**Purpose:**
This gallery search app was created using React. It demonstrates my abilities to use JavaScript, JSX, React Router, fetching data via Axios. I used the Flickr API to use and display images in my app. This is the final project for Unit 7 of the Treehouse Techdegree.

**Challenges:**
The most challenging part of this project was handling the navigation refetches for the search form and the navigation buttons.

**Future Consderations:**
In the future, I would love to add a suggested searches on the search bar functionality.

## Project Styling Customizations

-   I was able to clear the search field after a search is complete.
